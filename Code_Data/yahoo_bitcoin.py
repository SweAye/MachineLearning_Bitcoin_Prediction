"""
This program will live stream from the yahoo finical anaylis of bitcoin value in US dollar
- use the LinearRegression algorithm to predit the next 10 days of the stock
- other anaylis like stock aggresionness with volume and open and close percentage change
- if time permit , PCA will use the reduction of the dimension inorder to get the more accurency %
- try again with SVM also if time permit
- will use the every 4 repetation of 6 months ( saved data) worth data ( predit, 1 month) for perdition from 2017 January to June,  July to December, 2018 Janunary to Jue,July to Decemeber,
2019 April 1st to April 30  (May 1st to 9th predition) ( live Stream)
- how to show result?
- visualization
- use lineregression graph to compare the predicted data and real data (from the same website, same data as prediction)
- show accurency rate for the predicted data compare with algorithm accurency vs real data predition
